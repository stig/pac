A few features that would be nice to incorporate:

        * several levels -- the code is there to support it, very little
          additions should be needed. Re-init the board from a different
          file, that's all.

        * Keeping highscores

        * allow warp sones, so the tunnel in the original can be implemented.

        * using ncurses pads instead of screens, thus facilitating a larger
          playing area than the physical screen (this is probably a bit hard).

        * more consistent modular approach.

        * make ghosts vulnerable when pacman eats a big cherry.

        * clean up main_game_loop(), it is rather messy now.

        * clean up code, make sure we don't address out-of-bounds anywhere.

        * make ghosts slightly more likely to head toward pacman, at least on
          the higher levels.

	* make better use of autoconf/automake.
